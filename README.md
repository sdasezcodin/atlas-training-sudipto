The repository represents my learning journey through the ATLAS training program. While it started with basic implementations, it gradually evolved into more complex enterprise applications. The Mobile Store project added in the final days demonstrates a complete Spring Boot application with proper architecture and testing.

I've aimed to organize the code in a way that's easy to navigate and understand, making it useful not just as a record of my learning but also as a reference for specific Java implementations and design patterns.
