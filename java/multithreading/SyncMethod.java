/*
A Counter object is created with a synchronized increment() method.
Two threads (t1 and t2) are created using a MyRunnable class that:
Calls counter.increment() 1000 times in a loop.
Both threads share the same Counter instance, so:
increment() is synchronized on that instance.
Only one thread at a time can execute the increment() method.
t1.start() and t2.start() â†’ both threads run concurrently.
main() waits for both threads to finish using join().
