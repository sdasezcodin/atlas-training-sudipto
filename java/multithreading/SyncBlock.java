/*
A SyncBlockCounter object is created with an increment() method.
Inside increment(), only the count++ line is synchronized using synchronized(this), meaning:
Only one thread can execute the critical section at a time on the same object.
Two threads (t1 and t2) are created using SyncBlockRunnable, both sharing the same SyncBlockCounter instance.
Each thread runs a loop of 1000 iterations, calling counter.increment().
t1.start() and t2.start() â†’ both threads run concurrently.
Whenever a thread reaches the synchronized block, it locks the counter object:
The other thread must wait until the lock is released.
main() waits for both threads to complete using join().
